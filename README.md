## Installation Steps
1. burn a FreeDVDBoot iso onto a DVD-r (I used All PS2 Slims - English language.iso)
2. format a usb flash drive to FAT32
3. place the FMCB files onto this flash drive
   * (Optional) place Memory card annihilator (mca) on this flash drive as well. This allows you to backup and reformat memory cards easily.

5. put the flash drive into your PS2 and put the disc into your PS2 and then turn the system on, it will open uLaunchElf
6. navigate in the FMCB files to "FMCBInstaller.elf" and then launch it
7. CAUTION before you proceed ensure you have backup up the files on the memory card you are using because all files WILL BE WIPED
8. Now follow the installation steps in the FMCB installer.
9. Once the installer is finished you now have a memory card which will soft mod launch your PS2 into FreeMcBoot and OPL (Open PS2 Loader)! Upon removing this memory card your system will return to its vanilla unmoded state! You can also keep your FreeDVDBoot dvd around in case you want to lend it to a friend for making their own cards, but you don't need it anymore once you have created the memory card.
